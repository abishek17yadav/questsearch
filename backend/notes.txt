data storage - aisa kuch jaha par hum sare user ki info store kar sakte hai  very hard to stpre different types of data

database- it can store any data image text video anything

types of database = sql and no sql

}
no sql---mongodb is the database name which follows no sql

database comes in the backend part
in backedn we have 2 servers
1. Application servers = Node js  = handle routes and req and res etc.. things doing everything like login log out authentication ect... except data related works 
it will work first and if it needs any dayta then it will request  to the database server and fetch it from there and use it


2.database servers = mongodb
Database ->collection-> documents 
collections - all the data in a project like sales data customer data, product data etc all are collectionslike customer collection or sales collections or users collections

documents -from customer collection if we see 1 customer data then that data is a document
schemas-
keys-
models-

IN CODE                IN Database
------------------------------------------
mongoose.connect -> database is created
model create     -> collection is created
Create code           -> we create document
